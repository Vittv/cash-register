# Cash Register

<p>I did not implement user customization, since the course project did not require so.</p>
<p>In order to test this properly, you should download the file and edit the "price" and "cid" values.</p>

<pre><code>let price = 1.87;
let cid = [
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
];</code></pre>

<p>Doing so will let you test all the different outcomes this tool can offer.</p>
